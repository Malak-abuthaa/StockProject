# Stock Project
## OverView
Our Project had built as part of Project-rails course, designed  
using different technologies, for backend we used Python (Django-framework)  
and bash scripting, for frontend used javascript and html, and Database used MySQL,  
and hosted into aws server.<br/>
the main idea of stock-project is to enable the investors and stock traders  
to maximize their profits.  
#### Main Features
- Ability to track/watch particular stocks in real-time update.
- Comparing multiple stocks on one graph. 
- Adding notification rules to tracked/watched stock, like to notify when price of  
stock reaches Above/Below/On specific threshold, or when stock has a  
Positive/Negative change in price in the last X days, or when it's recommender   
to buy/sell/hold the stock (based on external recommendation-analyst service).    
- Buy and sell stocks and to increase/decrease user budget (simulated bank accounts).  
- Historic stocks transaction tracking, with amount of net profits gained by 
this transaction.
